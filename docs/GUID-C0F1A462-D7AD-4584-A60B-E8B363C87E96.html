The demonstration sends out generated audio waveforms (sine tone) using linked DMA channels with volume and frequency modifiable through the on-board push button. Success is indicated by an audible output corresponding to displayed parameters.</p>
<p class="p">The sine tone is one of four frequencies: 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz, sent by default at 48,000 samples/second, which is modifiable in the the MHC as described below.</p>
<p class="p">To know more about the MPLAB Harmony Codec Drivers, configuring the Codec Drivers, and the APIs provided by the Codec Drivers, refer to Codec Driver Libraries.</p>

<div class="topic nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="architecture"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Architecture</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">The two projects run on the SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Board, which contains a ATSAME70Q21B microcontroller with 2 MB of Flash memory and 384 KB of RAM running at 300 MHz using the following features:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">One push button (SW1)</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Two LEDs (LED1 and 2)</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">WM8904 Codec Daughter Board mounted on a X32 socket</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The SAM E70 Xplained Ultra board does not include the WM8904 Audio Codec daughterboard, which is sold separately on microchipDIRECT as part number AC328904.</p>
<p class="p">The program takes up to approximately 1% (17 KB) of the ATSAME70Q21B microcontroller’s program space. The 16-bit configuration uses 2% (6 KB) of the RAM. No heap is used.</p>
<p class="p">The following figure illustrates the application architecture for the two SAM E70 Xplained Ultra configurations:</p>
<br /><img class="image" src="GUID-AA462637-0403-4A54-BE00-47341D833EA0-low.png" /><br /><p class="p">Depending on the project, either the SSC (Synchronous Serial Controller) or I2SC (Inter-IC Sound Controller) is used with the WM8904 codec, selected by a strapping option on the WM8904 daughterboard. When using the SSC interface, the WM8904 is configured in master mode, meaning it generates the I<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>S clocks (LRCLK and BCLK), and the SSC peripheral is configured as a slave. When using the I2SC interface, the WM8904 is configured in slave mode and the SSC peripheral is a master and generates the I2SC clocks. The other two possibilities (SSC as master and WM8904 as slave, or I2SC as slave and WM8904 as master) are possible, but not discussed.</p>
<p class="p">The same application code is used without change between the two projects.</p>
<p class="p">The SAM E70 microcontroller (MCU) runs the application code, and communicates with the WM8904 codec via an I<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>C interface. The audio interface between the SAM E70 and the WM8904 codec use the I<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>S interface. Audio is configured as 16-bit, 48,000 samples/second, I<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>S format. (16-bit, 48 kHz is the standard rate used for DVD audio. An alternate that could be used is 44,100 samples/second. This is the same sample rate used for CD's. The sample rate is configurable in the MHC.)</p>
<p class="p">The Master Clock (MCLK) signal used by the codec is generated by the Peripheral Clock section of the SAM E70, and is fixed at 12 MHz.</p>
<p class="p">The button and LEDs are interfaced using GPIO pins. There is no screen.</p>
<p class="p">As with any MPLAB Harmony application, the SYS_Initialize function, which is located in the initialization.c source file, makes calls to initialize various subsystems as needed, such as the clock, ports, board support package (BSP), WM8904 codec, I2S, I2C, DMA, timers, and interrupts.</p>
<p class="p">The codec driver and the application state machines are all updated through calls located in the SYS_Tasks function in the tasks.c file.</p>
<p class="p">The application code is contained in the several source files. The application’s state machine (APP_Tasks) is contained in app.c. It first initializes the application, which includes APP_Tasks then periodically calls APP_Button_Tasks to process any pending button presses.</p>
<p class="p">Then the application state machine inside APP_Tasks is given control, which first gets a handle to a timer driver instance and sets up a periodic (alarm) callback. In the next state it gets a handle to the codec driver by calling the DRV_CODEC_Open function with a mode of DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE and sets up the volume.</p>
<p class="p">The application state machine then registers an event handler APP_CODEC_BufferEventHandler as a callback with the codec driver (which in turn is called by the DMA driver).</p>
<p class="p">Two buffers are used for generating a sine wave. Each contains the data for one cycle of audio. One is currently output on a repeated basis, and the second is filled in as necessary when the frequency changes. Then it is designated as the output buffer.</p>
<p class="p">Initially, values for both buffers are calculated in advance. Two calls to the function</p>
<p class="p">DRV_I2S_InitWriteLinkedListTransfer are made each passing the address of one buffer. The buffers are each linked back to themselves such that when one is done, it starts over again. A call to DRV_I2S_StartWriteLinkedListTransfer is made, which starts the DMA sending data using data from the first buffer to the codec.</p>
<p class="p">Only when the frequency is changed, due to a button press, does the second buffer come into play. In that case new values are calculated for the second buffer (while the first buffer continues to be used for output). When the second buffer has been filled in, a call is made to DRV_I2S_WriteNextLinkedListTransfer which transfers control to the second buffer after the first buffer finishes. The way the pointers are set up, it will then repeat on itself until another frequency change is made, and after which control will revert back to the first buffer.</p>
<p class="p">A table called samples contains the number of samples for each frequency that correspond to one cycle of audio (e.g. 48 for 48000 samples/sec, and a 1 kHz tone). <strong class="ph b">Note:</strong> the samples table will need to be modified if changing the sample rate to something other than 48000 samples/second.</p>
<p class="p">This value with the number of samples to be generated is then passed to the function APP_TONE_LOOKUP_TABLE_Initialize along with which buffer to work with (1 or 2) and the sample rate. The 16-bit value for each sample is calculated based on the relative distance (angle) from 0, based in turn on the current sample number and total number of samples for one cycle. First the angle is calculated in radians:</p>
<p class="p">double radians = (M_PI*(double)(360.0/(double)currNumSamples)*(double)i)/180.0;</p>
<p class="p">Then the sample value is calculated using the sine function:</p>
<p class="p">lookupTable<span class="xref"></span>.leftData = (int16_t)(0x7FFF*sin(radians));</p>
<p class="p">If the number of samples divides into the sample rate evenly, then only 1/4 (90°) of the samples are calculated, and the remainder is filled in by reflection. Otherwise each sample is calculated individually. Before returning, the size of the buffer is calculated based on the number of samples filled in.</p>
