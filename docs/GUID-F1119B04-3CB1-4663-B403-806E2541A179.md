# simple_tone_generator

This topic provides instructions and information about the MPLAB Harmony3 
Simple Tone Generation Demonstration application, which is included in the MPLAB 
Harmony Library distribution.

## Overview

This demonstration application configures the development board to implement a 
Tone Generator that outputs a 1 kHz Sine Tone, configured to run at 48 kHz sampling rate 
at 16 bit per sample.

The Sine Tone Audio is output through a WM8904 Codec Daughter Board mounted on X32 socket. 
The Audio can be heard at a speaker connected to the HP_OUT line 
of the Daughter board.

## Description

The application runs on the ARM processor ATSAMG55J19 
on the SAM G55 Curiosity Audio (G55Audio) board.
*   Processor runs @ 100 MHz
*   2 push buttons (SW1-SW3)
*   2 LEDs (LED1-LED2) 
*   WM8904 Codec Daughter Board mounted on X32 socket

![](GUID-047E20C7-8912-404E-B50B-8B3064E7E0BC-low.png) **Note:** The SAM G55 Curiosity Audio board does not include the
WM8904 Audio Codec daughterboard, which is sold separately on microchipDIRECT as
part number AC328904.

The application uses the MPLAB Code Configurator to setup the 
Audio Device, codec, and other items in order to play the tone through
the Codec Module.

## Demonstration Features

*   1  KHz Tone playback using a WM8904 codec daughterboard on the
    G55 Curiosity Audio board.
*   Utilization of the SAM G55 I2SC peripheral (as slave) to transfer 
    48Khz/16 Bit stereo tone.
*   Uses the Codec Driver Library to write audio samples to the WM8904

Note that this sample just illustrates the G55's Audio capablity.
This demonstration makes direct invocations of the registers from application.
One can refer to other demonstartions to see the proper architectural layering
required by Harmony Audio Architecture.

## Harmony MCC Component Blocks 

MPLAB-X Harmony 3 projects only have one associated
configuration. When each Harmony 3 project is created the MPLAB Code
Configurator (MCC) will support application driver and library code generation 
for the selected processor.

MCC code generation is supported by adding additional components 
to the project graph.  This includes Core peripheral support for the processor
device, the Harmony framework, and the board support package.

_Figure 1. Simple Tone Generator Project Graph for the G55Audio Board_

Note that in this basic example, the I2SC component of the SAM G55
does not use a Harmony 3 DMA driver, neither does it use SAM G55
Peripheral DMA Controller (PDC).

### Harmony Core Block

Start MCC for the project in order to add the Harmony and the application 
code components.  The Board Support Package (BSP) for the G55 Curiosity
board should be selected first from the Available Components.

Next,  the Harmony core is selected without FreeRTOS.
Answer Yes to all questions except for the one regarding FreeRTOS; answer No to
that one.

### Audio Codec Component Blocks

#### G55Audio WM8904 Daughter Board Component Block 

Under Audio\\Templates, double-click on WM8904 Codec Template.
Answer Yes to all questions.
This loads the WM8904 Codec component along with associated I2C and I2S
driver components.

### Harmony Code Configuration Options

Each block in the MCC Project Graph may need to be configured through parameters
for the specific application. These parameters are accessed by selecting the
block with the mouse, and appear in the Configuration Options window, where they
can be edited.

#### Audio Codec Configuration

##### The G55Audio WM8904 Codec Configuration

Using the G55Audio and the WM8904 Audio Codec Daughter Board:

![](GUID-82ACE2D2-CA50-43F4-A96B-4606DDEB84B8-low.png)    
_Figure 2. WM8904 Codec Configuration_

The WM8904 codec uses a I2C interface for configuration and control
register setting and I2SC interface. The settings are unchanged from
the generated values.

The I2SC0 peripheral driver is used to transfer 16 Bit Stereo
data.

The I2C blocks can be used without changes to the configuration

#### Pin Configurations

#### Clock Manager
The clock configuration diagram is shown using Tools/Clock Configuration menu

The I2S clocks are setup for 48KHz sampling rate, with stereo 16 bit 
samples, giving a 32 bit sample frame. 

#### G55 Audio Clock Generation
The clock configuration diagram is shown using Tools/Clock Configuration menu
selection.

PLLA is used for the peripheral clocks, including I2SC. 

### Harmony Code Generation

All the needed drivers, middleware, libraries and application framework code can
be generated from the MHC blocks (MHC components) placed in the MHC Project
Graph,

The generated framework code is placed under the firmware/src/config directory
under the name of the configuration used for the Harmony 3 project. The initial
application code is located in the firmware/src directory app.c and app.h files,
which utilize the framework drivers, middleware and library APIs located in
definitions.h located in the config directory.

All Harmony applications first execute the SYS_Initialize function, located in
initialization.c. This is executed from the main function to initialize various
subsystems such as the clock, ports, BSP (board support package), codec, 
timers, and interrupts. The application APP_Initialize function in app.c is
executed last in the generated SYS_Initialize routine after the system
initializations have completed.

The SYS_Tasks function (located in tasks.c) is used to update the
WM8904 driver, timers etc., as well as the application state machine (APP_tasks
routine in app.c). This function is executed from the main polling loop. The
polling loop executes SYS_Tasks repeatably in an infinite loop to perform
the updates.

The application utilizes a simple state machine (APP\_Tasks executed from
SYS_Tasks) with the following functions

1.  Opens the WM8904 codec for configuration.
2.  Repeatedly writes the Sine Tone Wave values over I2SC0

### Configuring the Hardware    

This section describes how to configure the supported hardware.

#### Using the SAM G55 Curiosity Audio and the WM8904 Daughter Board:

The G55Audio board and the WM8904 Audio Codec Daughter Board only
requires the daughterboard to be connected to the X32 Header as shown
below. The I2S Jumpers should all be set as shown, with jumpers placed
toward the blue Line-In jack, not the pink Microphone-In jack.

Jumper J305 on the G55Audio board shall select PA18.
